# Introduction #
My name is Ryan Pink, and I am a Software Engineering Technology graduate. In this project, I have compiled the beginnings of a code portfolio. All code provided here is for educational and demonstrative purposes only. All of them were developed for my college program under tight deadlines.

# Details #
These are the projects I currently have available for review.
  * C-to-C# Port Wizard - A (less) hackish code porting program designed to translate basic C source files into functional C# source.
  * Capstone Project - Together with my team, we developed software in ROS and Unity 5 game engine to interface between simulated and real sensor data seamlessly.
  * Fun With Typography - A quick little web app I made as an exercise in more modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  * How Happy - A quick-and-dirty web app for smart phones that I whipped up in an afternoon as a proof of concept for representing mood in a simple scale from 0-100. Touch and drag to show how happy you are.
  * Python Scripts
    * Differentiation Function - This script calculates the value of X of the derivative of a hard-coded mathematical function, given a certainty EPSILON input by the user.
	* Linear Interpolation Function - This function accepts two lists of values representing POSITION & TIME values, and outputs a position and velocity for a user-input time value.
	* Gauss-Jordan - This script accepts two files representing a matrix and a vector. It uses the Gauss-Jordan elimination method to solve the system of linear equations represented by the matrix-vector combination.
	* Integration Function - This script uses two methods of integral estimation (TRAPEZOIDAL and MONTE CARLO) to determine the value of X, given a number of iterations N input by the user.
	* Steganography - This script serves triple-duty. It is designed to scrape through a .IMG file for potentially deleted JPG pictures. It also encodes any scraped JPGs with a message provided in an input text file. Finally, it can extract a message from a JPG that was encoded using this script.
  * T-SQL Kanban Simulation - A series of MySQL scripts designed to simulate a 7-hour work day in a fog lamp factory.
  * TCP/UDP Benchmark - An application designed to test the speed and reliability of both the TCP/IP and UDP transfer protocols.
